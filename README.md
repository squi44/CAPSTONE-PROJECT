# Capstone Project - Fraud Detection

## Project Overview

### Area of Concern
I am focused on leveraging data science to detect fraud in financial transactions within the fields of accounting and finance. The challenge involves addressing the growing complexity of fraudulent activities leading to financial losses. The opportunity lies in developing models to identify patterns indicating fraud, enhancing the security of financial transactions.

### User Perspective
Businesses, banks, credit card companies, and online payment platforms face difficulties associated with fraud. Implementing the project's findings can provide an efficient way to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, minimizing losses and protecting reputations.

### Main Concept
The project aims to use machine learning for fraud detection by examining patterns and anomalies in transactions. Supervised learning for classification, unsupervised learning for anomaly detection, and ensemble methods will be employed. Previous methods involved analyzing transaction frequency, location data, transaction amounts, and utilizing algorithms to identify patterns indicating fraudulent behavior.

### Impact
The project holds both societal and business value, potentially saving billions of dollars, reducing investigation time and effort, and enhancing the overall security and reliability of financial transactions.

## Dataset Overview

The fraud detection project will utilize the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset created by the Machine Learning Group - ULB. This dataset contains transactions made by credit card holders in September 2013 by European cardholders. Key details include:
- 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions
- Dataset highly unbalanced, with frauds accounting for 0.172% of all transactions
- Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are PCA-transformed principal components
- 'Time' and 'Amount' are the only non-transformed features
- 'Time' represents seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction
- 'Amount' is the transaction amount
- 'Class' is the response variable, taking value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise

Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, original features and background information about the data cannot be provided.

## Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A Jupyter Notebook has been created to conduct a first pass over the data. The EDA aims to identify data quality issues, explore feature engineering opportunities, and make notable observations regarding data preprocessing. The initial analysis will also include visualizations to describe relationships between variables and formulate hypotheses for further analysis.

## Next Steps

The next steps involve detailed data processing, feature engineering, and baseline modeling. Thorough processing will handle missing values and outliers, while feature engineering will explore opportunities to enhance predictive capabilities. Baseline modeling will establish a foundation for further analysis, with a roadmap that includes refining models, conducting in-depth feature analysis, and iterating based on the results.
